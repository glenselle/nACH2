nACH is a Node.js module exposing both a high & low-level API for generating ACH (Automated Clearing House) files for use within the ACH network. It's design makes it a high-performance, dependable and frustration-free solution for developers.

 Note: nACH does not bundle a bank agreement/partnership to upload ACH files to the network :)

## Getting Started
To intall nACH, use NPM:

    $ npm i nach2-aimpoint --save-dev

Then include the NPM module like so:

```js
const nach = require('nach2-aimpoint')
```

Now you're ready to start creating ACH files.

## ACH File Basics
nACH implements the ACH file specification.

Each ACH file is a flat text file (.txt) which contains records and entries. Within both records and entries, are "columns" called fields. To get a sense for what an ACH file actually looks like, check out the example below:

Each line in an ACH file is always 94 bytes (or 94 characters) long, and the number of lines in an ACH file is required to *always* be a multiple of 10. This means, if a file doesn't contain enough rows of data to be a multiple of 10, the ACH specification requires you to fill in the remainder of the file with rows of 9s until the number of rows is a multiple of 10. Of course, nACH will handle all of this for you, but it's aways good to know why it's doing it.

## File Anatomy
Let's delve a little deeper into the anatomy of an ACH file. ACH files were originally created when punch-card computers were the "rave", so don't consider ACH files cutting-edge technology. They aren't. But they do provide a means by which to move money from one bank account to another--the entire purpose of the ACH network. As aforementioned, each ACH file has several sections known as "records". These are as follows:

    File header
      First batch header
        First detail record
        ...
        Last detail record
      First batch control
      Second batch header
        First detail record
        ...
        Last detail record
      Second batch control
    File control

As seen above, each file has one file header and one file control (similar to a footer or a closing html bracket). After the file header, the file can contain any number of batches and each batch may contain multiple entry details. While it may seem pointless to use different batches if all the entries could be inserted into one batch, there are various reasons one might choose to divide up entries into different batches. One such reason stems from the fact that only batch headers can specify when the entries within are to be deposited into the respective account. As a result, one might use batch headers to specify different deposit dates for a group of entries.

## Usage

To create a file:

```js
var file = new nach.File({
    immediateDestination: '081000032',
    immediateOrigin: '123456789',
    immediateDestinationName: 'Some Bank',
    immediateOriginName: 'Your Company Inc',
    referenceCode: '#A000001',
});
```

To create a batch

```js
var batch = new nach.Batch({
    serviceClassCode: '220',
    companyName: 'Your Company Inc',
    standardEntryClassCode: 'WEB',
    companyIdentification: '123456789',
    companyEntryDescription: 'Trans Description',
    companyDescriptiveDate: moment(nach.Utils.computeBusinessDay(8)).format('MMM D'),
    effectiveEntryDate: nach.Utils.computeBusinessDay(8),
    originatingDFI: '081000032'
});
```

To create an entry

```js
var entry = new nach.Entry({
    receivingDFI: '081000210',
    DFIAccount: '5654221',
    amount: '175',
    idNumber: 'RAj##32b1kn1bb3',
    individualName: 'Luke Skywalker',
    discretionaryData: 'A1',
    transactionCode: '22'
});
```

To add one or more optional addenda records to an entry

```js
var addenda = new nach.EntryAddenda({
    paymentRelatedInformation: "0123456789ABCDEFGJIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYXabcdefgjijklmnopqrstuvwxyx"
});
entry.addAdenda(addenda);
```

Entries are added to batches like so

```js
batch.addEntry(entry);
```

And batches are added to files much the same way

```js
file.addBatch(batch);
```

Finally to generate the file & write it to a text file

```js
// Generate the file (result is a string with the file contents)
file.generateFile(function(result) {

    // Write result to a NACHA.txt file
    fs.writeFile('NACHA.txt', result, function(err) {
        if(err) console.log(err);

        // Log the output
        console.log(fileString);
    });
});
```
